Lide Framework
==============

Lide Framework is a library that allows you to create multiplatform 
graphical interfaces from Lua language.
Lide uses wxWidgets to build controls and windows, this ensures the 
integration of your applications with GTK+ on Linux and really native 
controls in Windows.

Installation
============

First install lide shell from github:

**Note:**
Lide shell is a command line interpreter that makes sure that you 
have installed the correct versions of each library.

.. code-block:: bash

	$ mkdir lide && cd lide
	$ git clone https://github.com/lidesdk/shell.git --recursive
	$ export LIDE_PATH=$PWD

Manual installation
-------------------
- `Please follow the instructions for Windows. <https://github.com/lidesdk/shell/tree/master#windows-installation>`_
- `Or follow the instructions for GNU/Linux... <https://github.com/lidesdk/shell/tree/master#gnulinux-installation>`_

Auto Installer
--------------
* If you prefer automatic install on your system you can download the
  last stable version of lide shell installer: `from here <https://github.com/lidesdk/shell/releases>`_.


How to use it
=============

* Create a file ``main.lua``.

.. code-block:: lua
	
	lide = require 'lide.widgets.init'

	local Form   = lide.classes.widgets.form
	local Button = lide.classes.widgets.button

	local MessageBox = lide.core.base.messagebox

	form1 = Form:new { Name = 'form1',
		Title = 'Window Caption'
	};

	button1 = Button:new { Name = 'button1', Parent = form1,
		PosX = 10, PosY = 30, Text = 'Click me!',
	};

	button1.onClick : setHandler ( function ( event )
		lide.widgets.messagebox 'Hello world!'
	end );

	form1:show(true);


With the above code we are creating a new form and putting a button 
inside it at position (10, 30), clicking inside the button a message 
"Hello World" is displayed.

* Run the file ``main.lua`` with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash
	
	$ lide main.lua

This is all you need to start building applications, **should be noted
that these instructions work** similarly to Windows or GNU/Linux.
